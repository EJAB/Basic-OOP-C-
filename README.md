# Basic-OOP-C-
Final year assignment that displays basic OOP principles using Cpp
- Correct use of all access specifiers (public, private, protected) in an appropriate way.
- Over-loading using methods or constructors.
- Over-riding of a method.
- An example of Multiple Inheritance (it does not have to make perfect sense).
- Separate compilation with all classes in your assignment.
- Example use of a friend functions that receives an object of a class.
- Abstract classes with a method that is required in all derived classes.
- A class with a modified copy constructor and demonstrate the effect of this on pass-by-value and pass-by-reference calls.
- A working destructor with some basic functionality. Demonstrate it working in your main() function.
- Correct use of three over-loaded operators (e.g., +, = and ==) for one of your classes.
- Operations on pointers to arrays of objects. The operation should call the function that is defined in point 6 above.
- Use of all four C++ style casts. 
- Use of dynamic binding with virtual & non-virtual methods. Demonstrate the impact.
- Correct use of new and delete for the allocation of an object/objects, with operations on the object using pointers. (Can be combined with other points)
- Static states of a class and an example usage. Demonstrate the impact.
- Demonstrates the difference between a C++ class and a C++ struct.
- Passing an object to a method by constant reference. Demonstrate the impact.
- Write a straightforward class template.
- Use of the vector container to contain a number of objects of one of your classes.
- Use of an algorithm on your container.
